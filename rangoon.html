<h2>Want to learn how to make the most creamy, delicious rangoons?</h2>

<span class="text">
        <p>Crab Rangoon, sometimes called crab puffs, crab rangoon puffs, cheese wontons, or cream cheese rangoons, are filled crisp dumpling appetizers served primarily in American Chinese restaurants.</p>
        <p>The filling is made with a combination of cream cheese, crab meat or imitation crab meat, scallions or onion, garlic, and other flavorings.</p>
        <p>A small amount of the filling is wrapped in each wonton wrapper.</p>
        <p>The dumpling is then shaped by either folding the wrapper over into a triangle by creating a four-pointed star, by gathering it up into a flower or purse shape, or by twisting it into the traditional wonton shape.</p>

    <li>Chop imitation crab meat into small pieces, about 2 cm wide, and set aside.</li>
    <li>In a large bowl, soften room temperature cream cheese with a spatula until smooth.</li>
    <li>Add imitation crab meat into your bowl of softened cream cheese, along with the rest of filling ingredients as listed.</li>
    <li>With a fork, mix very well until crab meat breaks down.</li>
    <li>Use square wonton wrappers to wrap the cream cheese and crab filling. You can get wonton wrappers at Asian supermarkets or food stores. You can also find wonton wrappers in many regular supermarkets now, for example: Whole Foods.</li>
    <li>Wrap the cream cheese and crab mixture using wonton wrappers. Do not overfill with too much filling.</li>
    <li>Seal each wonton wrapper tight so there is no leakage. Pinch it up like a little purse and deep fry to golden brown.</li>
</ol>
